<br />
PikaMovie is an app that tackles the modern day decision fatigue by allowing users to quickly arrive at a decision that we must make ever so often: What To Watch? You will be able to store decisions in your account, save your favorite movies and add your own notes. Sign up and let our app make decisions for you!


[Stock Byte](https://stockbyte.herokuapp.com/) - Joe, Richie, Xena, Jeremy
<br />
Stock Byte is a portfolio tracking app. Starting on the homepage, you will be greeted with information on stock market basics, general business news, and stock market performance indicators.

Stock Byte is brokerage agnostic. If you have holdings with different firms (Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, etc.) you can track your trades in a single place. After signing up for an account, you can save a portfolio of stock picks that reflect your current holdings.

Stock Byte also comes with a playground mode allowing for strategy testing before you commit new trades or for simple bragging rights with your friends using the leaderboard.

[Tiqqit](https://www.Tiqqit.net) - Rudy, Andee, Tsz, Danny
<br />
Tiqqit is a minimalistic open source bug tracking tool, allowing its users to create, edit, delete tickets, and upload images. Built on React on Rails, it features Devise as its account authorization and authentication along with Giphy API for some fun easter eggs.
